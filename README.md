Task 3
Instruction 1:
Machine code lui a2,0x376
![Screenshot_from_2025-01-15_20-49-11 1](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/b4c49ab3-6f45-417e-a2c5-c5cd8713adc8)
Instruction: lui a2, 0x376
Address: 100b0
Machine Code: 00376637
Operation
Mnemonic: lui
Purpose: Load the immediate value 0x376 into the upper 20 bits of register a2 (x12). The lower 12 bits are set to 0.
Result in a2:
a2 = 0x37600000
Instruction Format (U-type for lui):
U-type format is:
[imm[31:12]] [rd] [opcode]
Immediate (imm[31:12]): A 20-bit value that is left-shifted by 12 to form the final 32-bit immediate value.
Destination Register (rd): Specifies where the result is stored.
Opcode: Specifies the operation (lui).
Immediate (imm[31:12]):
Immediate value 0x376 is converted to binary:
0x376 â†’ 0011 0111 0110
This is placed in the top 20 bits.
Destination Register (rd):
Register a2 corresponds to x12 in RISC-V architecture.
x12 in binary:01100
Opcode:
Opcode for lui is 0110111 (7 bits).
Binary Representation
Combining the fields into binary:
[imm[31:12]]      [rd]    [opcode]  
0011 0111 0110    01100   0110111
Complete binary instruction:
0011 0111 0110 01100 0110111
Hexadecimal Representation
Convert the binary representation into hexadecimal:
0011 0111 0110 01100 0110111 â†’ 0x00376637
